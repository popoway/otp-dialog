# otp-dialog  

This webapp is an one-time password viewer, compatible with Google One-time Password Algorithm. It doesn't require any server or additional resources.  

# Status

The app is already rather stable, so basic stuff should work.  
Further optimization (e.g. bootstrap, viewport) is required.

# Self-hosting 

Everything you need to host this app on your server is any static file server.
